6. Download dependencies by running the prompt 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
7. Run the cells in the Jupyter Notebook sequentially to construct and test the Neural Network from Scratch!

<b>Alternative for GPU/TPU Access</b>

For simplicity and access to an environment with TPUs/GPUs, copy this notebook or the content within each cell and paste it in a Google Colab notebook.
These notebooks are free to use if you have a google account and allow for faster training times. Note that any csv files will need to be saved and accessed by this program through the google drive of the user.
